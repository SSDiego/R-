#----Module 3: Vectors---------------------------------------------------------

#Numeric Vectors

# Here is an example creating a numeric vector named cost
cost <- c(50, 75, 90, 100, 150)

# Create a numeric vector to store the temperatures listed in the instructions 
#into a vector named temp
# Make sure to follow the same order in the instructions
temp <- c(35, 88, 42, 84, 81, 30)

#Character Vectors

# here is an example of how to create a character vector
food <- c("pizza", "burgers", "salads", "cheese", "pasta")

# Create a character vector called city to store the city names
# Make sure to follow the same order as in the instructions
city <- c("Beijing", "Lagos", "Paris", "Rio de Janeiro", "San Juan", "Toronto")

#Conecting

# Associate the cost values with its corresponding food item
cost <- c(50, 75, 90, 100, 150)
food <- c("pizza", "burgers", "salads", "cheese", "pasta")
names(cost) <- food

# You already wrote this code
temp <- c(35, 88, 42, 84, 81, 30)
city <- c("Beijing", "Lagos", "Paris", "Rio de Janeiro", "San Juan", "Toronto")

# Associate the temperature values with its corresponding city
names(temp) <- city

#Subsentting

# cost of the last 3 items in our food list:
cost[3:5]

# temperatures of the first three cities in the list:
temp[1:3]

# Access the cost of pizza and pasta from our food list 
cost[c(1,5)]

# Define temp
temp <- c(35, 88, 42, 84, 81, 30)
city <- c("Beijing", "Lagos", "Paris", "Rio de Janeiro", "San Juan", "Toronto")
names(temp) <- city

# Access the temperatures of Paris and San Juan
temp[c(3,5)]

#Sequences

# Create a vector m of integers that starts at 32 and ends at 99.
m <- 32:99

# Determine the length of object m.
length(m)

# Create a vector x of integers that starts 12 and ends at 73.

# Determine the length of object x.
x <- 12:73
length(x)

# Create a vector with the multiples of 7, smaller than 50.
seq(7, 49, 7) 

# Create a vector containing all the positive odd numbers smaller than 100.
# The numbers should be in ascending order
seq(1, 99, 2)

# We can a vector with the multiples of 7, smaller than 50 like this 
seq(7, 49, 7) 

# But note that the second argument does not need to be last number.
# It simply determines the maximum value permitted.
# so the following line of code produces the same vector as seq(7, 49, 7)
seq(7, 50, 7)

# Create a sequence of numbers from 6 to 55, with 4/7 increments and determine its length
length(seq(6, 55, 4/7))


# Store the sequence in the object a
a <- seq(1, 10, length.out = 100)

# Determine the class of a
class(a)

#Integers

# Store the sequence in the object a
a <- seq(1, 10)

# Determine the class of a
class(a)

# Check the class of 1, assigned to the object a
class(1)

# Confirm the class of 1L is integer
class(1L)

#Coertion

# Define the vector x
x <- c(1, 3, 5,"a")

# Note that the x is character vector
x

# Typecast the vector to get an integer vector
# You will get a warning but that is ok
x = as.numeric(x)
